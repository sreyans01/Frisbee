Built an Android app with a Myntra-like UI design backed by a Deep Learning model with 3 stages - Object Detection, Keypoint Extraction, and Feature vector embedding. The idea was to recommend similar fashion products of a famous influencer for the Gen-Z people through which the user can input an image/video, and the user will get the desired recommendations from the inventory (of 100+ items in our project) from most to least similar. The backend data was kept in Firebase, and most of the Android code is in MVVM.
